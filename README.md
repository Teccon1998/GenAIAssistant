BEMA - The Interactive AI Model

We created BEMA using LLM, Langchain, and OpenAI. It is an interactive chatbot much like ChatGPT. It can also be used for the specific case of writing a resume based on a job link that the user provides. 

1. First clone the repository using git clone

2. Create a python virtual environment:
   
      Create a Python virtual enviroment for Windows
   
      `python -m venv venv`
       
      Create a python virtual environment for Mac
   
      `python3 -m venv venv`
       
      Activating Virtual enviroment in Python for Windows
   
      `venv\Scripts\activate`
       
      Activating Virtual enviroment in Pyhton for Mac
   
      `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Once the virtual environment is activated please run this in the terminal command line of the project

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Finally run the command below to start the project:

   `streamlit run Login.py`
